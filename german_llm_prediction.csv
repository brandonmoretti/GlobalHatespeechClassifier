Muslims simply cannot be trusted.,Muslim.
How bad is that? Politicians who are afraid and have no idea hide behind children who have no idea. Sweep them away! We deserve better. Only the AfD may still be eligible for election.,Immigrant.
"All I see is an inhumane right-wing populist who doesn't care about the death of people. Humanity is completely alien to him, but not Ms. Merkel. We have an obligation, arising from two world wars, to protect people who cannot do it themselves!  Mr. Meuthen probably didn't understand that!",None.
"“Consequences under immigration law” must also be introduced at train stations. Once again a woman, this time with a child, was pushed into the track bed by a foreigner, and the child died.

  It may be that the easiest thing would be to finally close the borders! It is now well known from the secret paper that this works and also happened in 2015!

"So what. It works. Because of Corona, people almost completely forgot about the victims of distress at sea (now called migrants).
